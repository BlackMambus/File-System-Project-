# File-System-Project-

A file system is a fundamental component of an operating system that manages how data is stored, retrieved, and organized on storage devices like hard drives, SSDs, and memory cards. It acts as the digital librarian—keeping track of where files live and how they’re accessed.

📁 Core Functions
Data Storage Organization: Files are organized into directories (folders) for easy navigation and management.

Access Control: Sets permissions to determine who can read, write, or execute files.

File Naming and Metadata: Assigns names and stores attributes like size, type, creation date, and modification time.

Indexing and Retrieval: Efficiently locates files using pointers, inodes, or tables.

Space Allocation: Manages blocks of memory and ensures efficient use of disk space.
